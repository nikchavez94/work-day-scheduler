# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
## Steps 
In order to complete this assignment I started from what I felt was the beginning. I checked to make sure the js file was linked to the html. Then I added the current date and time to the top of the screen in the header section. I used the dayjs library to create the code. Then I added in a setInterval to the previously created function to make sure the time updated every minute. Then I started by adding in the time blocks from 9-5. I had to be sure to specify the 9AM-5PM in army time terms for the computer to read it properly and give me the right times. I added completely new ones, even though there were three already created in the HTML. I used the information in the div that was precreated in HTML to set up the new divs for the timeblocks using javascript with the original div adjustments. After that, I appended the newly created time blocks to the container. Next, I needed to create a function that would change the color of the boxes based on the time. I used a for and if statement to create that code. Lastly, I created the code to save any text that was saved to local storage so that it would save even if the page was refreshed. 

## Contributers 
I used chatgpt for debugging and to help create some of the functions. I was able to give her specific steps and ideas, and she gave me the codes I asked for in most cases.
